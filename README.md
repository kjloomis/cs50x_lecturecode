# CS50x Lecture Sample Code Repository
This collection of code is created to complement CS50x Miami lecture series.
This course is an adaptation of [CS50](https://www.cs50.net), [Harvard University's](http://www.harvard.edu)
introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science, and the art of programming,
for MDC students and the South Florida community. All credit for Harvard's CS50 goes to
[David Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) and his team. It's a great introductory course to
programming and provides breadth and depth without being too overwhelming. Check out
[CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) to learn more about
the online version of CS50.

All code presented here is for educational purposes only and does not knowingly contain any solutions
to Psets, Exams, or other assignments for CS50 or CS50x. Feel free to use this code for your own
courses, self-instruction, or personal use but please retain the attribution to this source.
